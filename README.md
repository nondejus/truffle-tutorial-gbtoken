# truffle-tutorial-gbtoken
Tutorial project demonstrating Truffle's ease and ability to deploy contracts and interact with them via web3 and Javascript. We configure the project in truffle.js (and truffle-config.js for Windows PCs) to use a personal (Ganache) blockchain. This can be swapped out with another network (e.g. Ropsten testnet).

## Instructions for building this project yourself, from scratch.
Coming soon.
